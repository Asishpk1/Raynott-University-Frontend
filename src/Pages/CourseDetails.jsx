                <hr />
                <p>The American Literature course provides an in-depth exploration of the rich and diverse literary traditions of the United States, tracing their evolution from early colonial writings to the innovative, multifaceted voices of the contemporary era. The curriculum is designed for students who seek a deeper understanding of how America’s complex history, cultural shifts, and social transformations have shaped its literary identity over the centuries. Through a blend of textual analysis, historical study, and critical interpretation, this course examines how themes such as freedom, identity, race, gender, migration, and the American Dream have been represented, challenged, and reimagined by different generations of writers.

                    Students engage closely with a wide range of literary genres—including poetry, fiction, drama, autobiographical narratives, and political essays—to gain insights into the artistic methods, philosophical questions, and societal tensions reflected in American writing. From the earliest Puritan sermons and Native American oral traditions to the works of transcendentalists, modernists, and contemporary multicultural authors, the course encourages learners to explore how literature both mirrors and critiques the nation’s evolving cultural landscape.

                    Beyond reading and interpretation, the course emphasizes the development of strong analytical and academic writing skills. Learners will examine each text within its historical context, consider the influence of major cultural movements, and discuss how literature shapes national identity. By the end of the course, students will not only gain a solid foundation in American literary history but will also cultivate a broader appreciation for the stories, perspectives, and creative voices that continue to influence American society and global literature today.</p>
